This directory contains data used for a portion of my submission of the STAT 184 Activity 04 assignment. There are two comma-separated-values files in the directory: a "tidy" table of family member heights from scientist Francis Galton's notebooks ("galton_tidy_table.csv") and a "non-tidy" table of soldier data from the US Armed Forces organized by service branch, soldier gender, pay grade, and amount of soldiers ("US_armed_forces.csv"). The directory's purpose is to store the data sets that are referenced in the R code file used for the Activity 04 assignment.
